# mnist

A simple neural network classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The specific data file was
obtained from Michael Nielsen's 
[Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning).

The neural network uses stochasitc gradient descent to train the model. The neural network will not be 
maintained across instances.  

## Usage

From `mnist` as the working directory, run

```
$ python3 main.py
```
